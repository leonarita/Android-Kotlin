    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Léo.
\n\nI love programming.
\n\nI can love programming, but I don\'t do this every day.
\nFun fact is that devs always use stackoverflow.
\n\nI try using Linux every weekday because this is not easy. Isn\'t more secure, is different. The different is not bad. Just different.
\nAnd sometimes I back to where I was when I started. The C Language.
\n\nOnce, when I was studying Data Structures, in my enthusiasm, I did a project in pairs alone.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your first code.
\nYou should ask someone else about programming, though.\n\n</string>
